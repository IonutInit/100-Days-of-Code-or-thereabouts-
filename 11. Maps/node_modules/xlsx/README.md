## Getting Started

### Installation

**Standalone Browser Scripts**

The complete browser standalone build is saved to `dist/xlsx.full.min.js` and can be directly added to a page with a `script` tag:

```html
<script lang="javascript" src="dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
```

<details>

<summary>CDN Availability (click to show)</summary>

For example, `unpkg` makes the latest version available at:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/xlsx/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Browser builds (click to show)</summary>

The complete single-file version is generated at `dist/xlsx.full.min.js`

`dist/xlsx.core.min.js` omits codepage library (no support for XLS encodings)

A slimmer build is generated at `dist/xlsx.mini.min.js`. Compared to full build:

* codepage library skipped (no support for XLS encodings)
* no support for XLSB / XLS / Lotus 1-2-3 / SpreadsheetML 2003 / Numbers
* node stream utils removed

</details>

With [bower](https://bower.io/search/?q=js-xlsx):

```bash
$ bower install js-xlsx
```

**ECMAScript Modules**

The ECMAScript Module build is saved to `xlsx.mjs` and can be directly added to a page with a `script` tag using `type=module`:

```html
<script type="module">
import { read, writeFileXLSX } from "./xlsx.mjs";

/* load the codepage support library for extended support with older formats  */
import { set_cptable } from "./xlsx.mjs";
import * as cptable from './dist/cpexcel.full.mjs';
set_cptable(cptable);
</script>
```

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/xlsx) also exposes the module with the `module` parameter, supported in Angular and other projects:

```ts
import { read, writeFileXLSX } from "xlsx";

/* load the codepage support library for extended support with older formats  */
import { set_cptable } from "xlsx";
import * as cptable from 'xlsx/dist/cpexcel.full.mjs';
set_cptable(cptable);
```

**Deno**

`xlsx.mjs` can be imported in Deno. It is available from `unpkg`:

```ts
// @deno-types="https://unpkg.com/xlsx/types/index.d.ts"
import * as XLSX from 'https://unpkg.com/xlsx/xlsx.mjs';

/* load the codepage support library for extended support with older formats  */
import * as cptable from 'https://unpkg.com/xlsx/dist/cpexcel.full.mjs';
XLSX.set_cptable(cptable);
```

**NodeJS**

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/xlsx):

```bash
$ npm install xlsx
```

By default, the module supports `require`:

```js
var XLSX = require("xlsx");
```

The module also ships with `xlsx.mjs` for use with `import`:

```js
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx/xlsx.mjs';

/* load 'fs' for readFile and writeFile support */
import * as fs from 'fs';
XLSX.set_fs(fs);

/* load 'stream' for stream support */
import { Readable } from 'stream';
XLSX.stream.set_readable(Readable);

/* load the codepage support library for extended support with older formats  */
import * as cpexcel from 'xlsx/dist/cpexcel.full.mjs';
XLSX.set_cptable(cpexcel);
```

**Photoshop and InDesign**

`dist/xlsx.extendscript.js` is an ExtendScript build for Photoshop and InDesign that is included in the `npm` package. It can be directly referenced with a `#include` directive:

```
#include "xlsx.extendscript.js"
```

<details>

<summary>Internet Explorer and ECMAScript 3 Compatibility (click to show)</summary>

For broad compatibility with JavaScript engines, the library is written using ECMAScript 3 language dialect as well as some ES5 features like `Array#forEach`. Older browsers require shims to provide missing functions.

To use the shim, add the shim before the script tag that loads `xlsx.js`:

```html
<!-- add the shim first -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="shim.min.js"></script>
<!-- after the shim is referenced, add the library -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
```

The script also includes `IE_LoadFile` and `IE_SaveFile` for loading and saving files in Internet Explorer versions 6-9. The `xlsx.extendscript.js` script bundles the shim in a format suitable for Photoshop and other Adobe products.

### Usage

Most scenarios involving spreadsheets and data can be broken into 5 parts:

1. **Acquire Data**: Data may be stored anywhere: local or remote files, databases, HTML TABLE, or even generated programmatically in the web browser.
2. **Extract Data**: For spreadsheet files, this involves parsing raw bytes to read the cell data. For general JS data, this involves reshaping the data.
3. **Process Data**: From generating summary statistics to cleaning data records, this step is the heart of the problem.
4. **Package Data**: This can involve making a new spreadsheet or serializing with `JSON.stringify` or writing XML or simply flattening data for UI tools.
5. **Release Data**: Spreadsheet files can be uploaded to a server or written locally. Data can be presented to users in an HTML TABLE or data grid.

A common problem involves generating a valid spreadsheet export from data stored in an HTML table. In this example, an HTML TABLE on the page will be scraped, a row will be added to the bottom with the date of the report, and a new file will be generated and downloaded locally. `XLSX.writeFile` takes care of packaging the data and attempting a local download:

```js
// Acquire Data (reference to the HTML table)
var table_elt = document.getElementById("my-table-id");

// Extract Data (create a workbook object from the table)
var workbook = XLSX.utils.table_to_book(table_elt);

// Process Data (add a new row)
var ws = workbook.Sheets["Sheet1"];
XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(ws, [["Created "+new Date().toISOString()]], {origin:-1});

// Package and Release Data (`writeFile` tries to write and save an XLSB file)
XLSX.writeFile(workbook, "Report.xlsb");
```

This library tries to simplify steps 2 and 4 with functions to extract useful data from spreadsheet files (`read` / `readFile`) and generate new spreadsheet files from data (`write` / `writeFile`). Additional utility functions like `table_to_book` work with other common data sources like HTML tables.

This documentation and various demo projects cover a number of common scenarios and approaches for steps 1 and 5.

Utility functions help with step 3.

["Acquiring and Extracting Data"](./#acquiring-and-extracting-data) describes solutions for common data import scenarios.

["Packaging and Releasing Data"](./#packaging-and-releasing-data) describes solutions for common data export scenarios.

["Processing Data"](./#packaging-and-releasing-data) describes solutions for common workbook processing and manipulation scenarios.

["Utility Functions"](./#utility-functions) details utility functions for translating JSON Arrays and other common JS structures into worksheet objects.

### The Zen of SheetJS

_Data processing should fit in any workflow_

The library does not impose a separate lifecycle. It fits nicely in websites and apps built using any framework. The plain JS data objects play nice with Web Workers and future APIs.

_JavaScript is a powerful language for data processing_

The ["Common Spreadsheet Format"](./#common-spreadsheet-format) is a simple object representation of the core concepts of a workbook. The various functions in the library provide low-level tools for working with the object.

For friendly JS processing, there are utility functions for converting parts of a worksheet to/from an Array of Arrays. The following example combines powerful JS Array methods with a network request library to download data, select the information we want and create a workbook file:

<details>

<summary>Get Data from a JSON Endpoint and Generate a Workbook (click to show)</summary>

The goal is to generate a XLSB workbook of US President names and birthdays.

**Acquire Data**

_Raw Data_

[https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/executive.json](https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/executive.json) has the desired data. For example, John Adams:

```js
{
  "id": { /* (data omitted) */ },
  "name": {
    "first": "John",          // <-- first name
    "last": "Adams"           // <-- last name
  },
  "bio": {
    "birthday": "1735-10-19", // <-- birthday
    "gender": "M"
  },
  "terms": [
    { "type": "viceprez", /* (other fields omitted) */ },
    { "type": "viceprez", /* (other fields omitted) */ },
    { "type": "prez", /* (other fields omitted) */ } // <-- look for "prez"
  ]
}
```

_Filtering for Presidents_

The dataset includes Aaron Burr, a Vice President who was never President!

`Array#filter` creates a new array with the desired rows. A President served at least one term with `type` set to `"prez"`. To test if a particular row has at least one `"prez"` term, `Array#some` is another native JS function. The complete filter would be:

```js
const prez = raw_data.filter(row => row.terms.some(term => term.type === "prez"));
```

_Lining up the data_

For this example, the name will be the first name combined with the last name (`row.name.first + " " + row.name.last`) and the birthday will be the subfield `row.bio.birthday`. Using `Array#map`, the dataset can be massaged in one call:

```js
const rows = prez.map(row => ({
  name: row.name.first + " " + row.name.last,
  birthday: row.bio.birthday
}));
```

The result is an array of "simple" objects with no nesting:

```js
[
  { name: "George Washington", birthday: "1732-02-22" },
  { name: "John Adams", birthday: "1735-10-19" },
  // ... one row per President
]
```

**Extract Data**

With the cleaned dataset, `XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet` generates a worksheet:

```js
const worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(rows);
```

`XLSX.utils.book_new` creates a new workbook and `XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet` appends a worksheet to the workbook. The new worksheet will be called "Dates":

```js
const workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, "Dates");
```

**Process Data**

_Fixing headers_

By default, `json_to_sheet` creates a worksheet with a header row. In this case, the headers come from the JS object keys: "name" and "birthday".

The headers are in cells A1 and B1. `XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa` can write text values to the existing worksheet starting at cell A1:

```js
XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [["Name", "Birthday"]], { origin: "A1" });
```

_Fixing Column Widths_

Some of the names are longer than the default column width. Column widths are set by [setting the `"!cols"` worksheet property](./#row-and-column-properties).

The following line sets the width of column A to approximately 10 characters:

```js
worksheet["!cols"] = [ { wch: 10 } ]; // set column A width to 10 characters
```

One `Array#reduce` call over `rows` can calculate the maximum width:

```js
const max_width = rows.reduce((w, r) => Math.max(w, r.name.length), 10);
worksheet["!cols"] = [ { wch: max_width } ];
```

Note: If the starting point was a file or HTML table, `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json` will generate an array of JS objects.

**Package and Release Data**

`XLSX.writeFile` creates a spreadsheet file and tries to write it to the system. In the browser, it will try to prompt the user to download the file. In NodeJS, it will write to the local directory.

```js
XLSX.writeFile(workbook, "Presidents.xlsx");
```

**Complete Example**

```js
// Uncomment the next line for use in NodeJS:
// const XLSX = require("xlsx"), axios = require("axios");

(async() => {
  /* fetch JSON data and parse */
  const url = "https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/executive.json";
  const raw_data = (await axios(url, {responseType: "json"})).data;

  /* filter for the Presidents */
  const prez = raw_data.filter(row => row.terms.some(term => term.type === "prez"));

  /* flatten objects */
  const rows = prez.map(row => ({
    name: row.name.first + " " + row.name.last,
    birthday: row.bio.birthday
  }));

  /* generate worksheet and workbook */
  const worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(rows);
  const workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();
  XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, "Dates");

  /* fix headers */
  XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [["Name", "Birthday"]], { origin: "A1" });

  /* calculate column width */
  const max_width = rows.reduce((w, r) => Math.max(w, r.name.length), 10);
  worksheet["!cols"] = [ { wch: max_width } ];

  /* create an XLSX file and try to save to Presidents.xlsx */
  XLSX.writeFile(workbook, "Presidents.xlsx");
})();
```

For use in the web browser, assuming the snippet is saved to `snippet.js`, script tags should be used to include the `axios` and `xlsx` standalone builds:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/xlsx/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
<script src="snippet.js"></script>
```

</details>

_File formats are implementation details_

The parser covers a wide gamut of common spreadsheet file formats to ensure that "HTML-saved-as-XLS" files work as well as actual XLS or XLSX files.

The writer supports a number of common output formats for broad compatibility with the data ecosystem.

To the greatest extent possible, data processing code should not have to worry about the specific file formats involved.

## Acquiring and Extracting Data

### Parsing Workbooks

**API**

_Extract data from spreadsheet bytes_

```js
var workbook = XLSX.read(data, opts);
```

The `read` method can extract data from spreadsheet bytes stored in a JS string, "binary string", NodeJS buffer or typed array (`Uint8Array` or `ArrayBuffer`).

_Read spreadsheet bytes from a local file and extract data_

```js
var workbook = XLSX.readFile(filename, opts);
```

The `readFile` method attempts to read a spreadsheet file at the supplied path. Browsers generally do not allow reading files in this way (it is deemed a security risk), and attempts to read files in this way will throw an error.

The second `opts` argument is optional. ["Parsing Options"](./#parsing-options) covers the supported properties and behaviors.

**Examples**

Here are a few common scenarios (click on each subtitle to see the code):

<details>

<summary>Local file in a NodeJS server (click to show)</summary>

`readFile` uses `fs.readFileSync` under the hood:

```js
var XLSX = require("xlsx");

var workbook = XLSX.readFile("test.xlsx");
```

For Node ESM, the `readFile` helper is not enabled. Instead, `fs.readFileSync` should be used to read the file data as a `Buffer` for use with `XLSX.read`:

```js
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import { read } from "xlsx/xlsx.mjs";

const buf = readFileSync("test.xlsx");
/* buf is a Buffer */
const workbook = read(buf);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Local file in a Deno application (click to show)</summary>

`readFile` uses `Deno.readFileSync` under the hood:

```js
// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/sheetjs/types/index.d.ts"
import * as XLSX from 'https://deno.land/x/sheetjs/xlsx.mjs'

const workbook = XLSX.readFile("test.xlsx");
```

Applications reading files must be invoked with the `--allow-read` flag. The [`deno` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/deno/) has more examples

</details>

<details>

<summary>User-submitted file in a web page ("Drag-and-Drop") (click to show)</summary>

For modern websites targeting Chrome 76+, `File#arrayBuffer` is recommended:

```js
// XLSX is a global from the standalone script

async function handleDropAsync(e) {
  e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault();
  const f = e.dataTransfer.files[0];
  /* f is a File */
  const data = await f.arrayBuffer();
  /* data is an ArrayBuffer */
  const workbook = XLSX.read(data);

  /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
}
drop_dom_element.addEventListener("drop", handleDropAsync, false);
```

For maximal compatibility, the `FileReader` API should be used:

```js
function handleDrop(e) {
  e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault();
  var f = e.dataTransfer.files[0];
  /* f is a File */
  var reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = function(e) {
    var data = e.target.result;
    /* reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file) -> data will be an ArrayBuffer */
    var workbook = XLSX.read(data);

    /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
  };
  reader.readAsArrayBuffer(f);
}
drop_dom_element.addEventListener("drop", handleDrop, false);
```

[https://oss.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/](https://oss.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/) demonstrates the FileReader technique.

</details>

<details>

<summary>User-submitted file with an HTML INPUT element (click to show)</summary>

Starting with an HTML INPUT element with `type="file"`:

```html
<input type="file" id="input_dom_element">
```

For modern websites targeting Chrome 76+, `Blob#arrayBuffer` is recommended:

```js
// XLSX is a global from the standalone script

async function handleFileAsync(e) {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  const data = await file.arrayBuffer();
  /* data is an ArrayBuffer */
  const workbook = XLSX.read(data);

  /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
}
input_dom_element.addEventListener("change", handleFileAsync, false);
```

For broader support (including IE10+), the `FileReader` approach is recommended:

```js
function handleFile(e) {
  var file = e.target.files[0];
  var reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = function(e) {
    var data = e.target.result;
    /* reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file) -> data will be an ArrayBuffer */
    var workbook = XLSX.read(e.target.result);

    /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
  };
  reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);
}
input_dom_element.addEventListener("change", handleFile, false);
```

The [`oldie` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/oldie/) shows an IE-compatible fallback scenario.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Fetching a file in the web browser ("Ajax") (click to show)</summary>

For modern websites targeting Chrome 42+, `fetch` is recommended:

```js
// XLSX is a global from the standalone script

(async() => {
  const url = "http://oss.sheetjs.com/test_files/formula_stress_test.xlsx";
  const data = await (await fetch(url)).arrayBuffer();
  /* data is an ArrayBuffer */
  const workbook = XLSX.read(data);

  /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
})();
```

For broader support, the `XMLHttpRequest` approach is recommended:

```js
var url = "http://oss.sheetjs.com/test_files/formula_stress_test.xlsx";

/* set up async GET request */
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET", url, true);
req.responseType = "arraybuffer";

req.onload = function(e) {
  var workbook = XLSX.read(req.response);

  /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
};

req.send();

#include "xlsx.extendscript.js"

/* Read test.xlsx from the Documents folder */
var workbook = XLSX.readFile(Folder.myDocuments + "/test.xlsx");

<summary>Local file in a mobile app with React Native (click to show)</summary>

The [`react` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/react/) includes a sample React Native app.

Since React Native does not provide a way to read files from the filesystem, a third-party library must be used. The following libraries have been tested:

* [`react-native-file-access`](https://npm.im/react-native-file-access)

The `base64` encoding returns strings compatible with the `base64` type:

```js
import XLSX from "xlsx";
import { FileSystem } from "react-native-file-access";

const b64 = await FileSystem.readFile(path, "base64");
/* b64 is a base64 string */
const workbook = XLSX.read(b64, {type: "base64"});
```

* [`react-native-fs`](https://npm.im/react-native-fs)

The `ascii` encoding returns binary strings compatible with the `binary` type:

```js
import XLSX from "xlsx";
import { readFile } from "react-native-fs";

const bstr = await readFile(path, "ascii");
/* bstr is a binary string */
const workbook = XLSX.read(bstr, {type: "binary"});
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>NodeJS Server File Uploads (click to show)</summary>

`read` can accept a NodeJS buffer. `readFile` can read files generated by a HTTP POST request body parser like [`formidable`](https://npm.im/formidable):

```js
const XLSX = require("xlsx");
const http = require("http");
const formidable = require("formidable");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const form = new formidable.IncomingForm();
  form.parse(req, (err, fields, files) => {
    /* grab the first file */
    const f = Object.entries(files)[0][1];
    const path = f.filepath;
    const workbook = XLSX.readFile(path);

    /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
  });
}).listen(process.env.PORT || 7262);
```

<summary>Download files in a NodeJS process (click to show)</summary>

Node 17.5 and 18.0 have native support for fetch:

```js
const XLSX = require("xlsx");

const data = await (await fetch(url)).arrayBuffer();
/* data is an ArrayBuffer */
const workbook = XLSX.read(data);
```

For broader compatibility, third-party modules are recommended.

[`request`](https://npm.im/request) requires a `null` encoding to yield Buffers:

```js
var XLSX = require("xlsx");
var request = require("request");

request({url: url, encoding: null}, function(err, resp, body) {
  var workbook = XLSX.read(body);

  /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
});
```

[`axios`](https://npm.im/axios) works the same way in browser and in NodeJS:

```js
const XLSX = require("xlsx");
const axios = require("axios");

(async() => {
  const res = await axios.get(url, {responseType: "arraybuffer"});
  /* res.data is a Buffer */
  const workbook = XLSX.read(res.data);

  /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
})();
```

req.on("response", (res) => {
  const bufs = []; // this array will collect all of the buffers

<summary>ReadableStream in the browser (click to show)</summary>

When dealing with `ReadableStream`, the easiest approach is to buffer the stream and process the whole thing at the end:

  /* collect data */
  const buffers = [];
  const reader = stream.getReader();
  for(;;) {
    const res = await reader.read();
    if(res.value) buffers.push(res.value);
    if(res.done) break;
  }

  /* concat */
  const out = new Uint8Array(buffers.reduce((acc, v) => acc + v.length, 0));

  let off = 0;
  for(const u8 of arr) {
    out.set(u8, off);
    off += u8.length;

const workbook = XLSX.read(data);
```

### Processing JSON and JS Data

JSON and JS data tend to represent single worksheets. This section will use a few utility functions to generate workbooks.

_Create a new Workbook_

```js
var workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();
```

The `book_new` utility function creates an empty workbook with no worksheets.

Spreadsheet software generally require at least one worksheet and enforce the requirement in the user interface. This library enforces the requirement at write time, throwing errors if an empty workbook is passed to write functions.

**API**

_Create a worksheet from an array of arrays of JS values_

```js
var worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(aoa, opts);
```

The `aoa_to_sheet` utility function walks an "array of arrays" in row-major order, generating a worksheet object. The following snippet generates a sheet with cell `A1` set to the string `A1`, cell `B1` set to `B1`, etc:

```js
var worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([
  ["A1", "B1", "C1"],
  ["A2", "B2", "C2"],
  ["A3", "B3", "C3"]
]);
```

["Array of Arrays Input"](./#array-of-arrays-input) describes the function and the optional `opts` argument in more detail.

_Create a worksheet from an array of JS objects_

```js
var worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(jsa, opts);
```

The `json_to_sheet` utility function walks an array of JS objects in order, generating a worksheet object. By default, it will generate a header row and one row per object in the array. The optional `opts` argument has settings to control the column order and header output.

["Array of Objects Input"](./#array-of-arrays-input) describes the function and the optional `opts` argument in more detail.

**Examples**

["Zen of SheetJS"](./#the-zen-of-sheetjs) contains a detailed example "Get Data from a JSON Endpoint and Generate a Workbook"

[`x-spreadsheet`](https://github.com/myliang/x-spreadsheet) is an interactive data grid for previewing and modifying structured data in the web browser. The [`xspreadsheet` demo](../../../demos/xspreadsheet/) includes a sample script with the `xtos` function for converting from x-spreadsheet data object to a workbook. [https://oss.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/x-spreadsheet](https://oss.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/x-spreadsheet) is a live demo.

<summary>Numerical Computations with TensorFlow.js (click to show)</summary>

[`@tensorflow/tfjs`](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/@tensorflow/tfjs/) and other libraries expect data in simple arrays, well-suited for worksheets where each column is a data vector. That is the transpose of how most people use spreadsheets, where each row is a vector.

When recovering data from `tfjs`, the returned data points are stored in a typed array. An array of arrays can be constructed with loops. `Array#unshift` can prepend a title row before the conversion:

```js
const XLSX = require("xlsx");
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

/* suppose xs and ys are vectors (1D tensors) -> tfarr will be a typed array */
const tfdata = tf.stack([xs, ys]).transpose();
const shape = tfdata.shape;
const tfarr = tfdata.dataSync();

/* construct the array of arrays */
const aoa = [];
for(let j = 0; j < shape[0]; ++j) {
  aoa[j] = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < shape[1]; ++i) aoa[j][i] = tfarr[j * shape[1] + i];
}
/* add headers to the top */
aoa.unshift(["x", "y"]);

/* generate worksheet */
const worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(aoa);
```

The [`array` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/array/) shows a complete example.

</details>

### Processing HTML Tables

**API**

_Create a worksheet by scraping an HTML TABLE in the page_

```js
var worksheet = XLSX.utils.table_to_sheet(dom_element, opts);
```

The `table_to_sheet` utility function takes a DOM TABLE element and iterates through the rows to generate a worksheet. The `opts` argument is optional. ["HTML Table Input"](./#html-table-input) describes the function in more detail.

_Create a workbook by scraping an HTML TABLE in the page_

```js
var workbook = XLSX.utils.table_to_book(dom_element, opts);
```

The `table_to_book` utility function follows the same logic as `table_to_sheet`. After generating a worksheet, it creates a blank workbook and appends the spreadsheet.

The options argument supports the same options as `table_to_sheet`, with the addition of a `sheet` property to control the worksheet name. If the property is missing or no options are specified, the default name `Sheet1` is used.

**Examples**

Here are a few common scenarios (click on each subtitle to see the code):

<details>

<summary>HTML TABLE element in a webpage (click to show)</summary>

```html
<!-- include the standalone script and shim.  this uses the UNPKG CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/xlsx/dist/shim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/xlsx/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>

<!-- example table with id attribute -->
<table id="tableau">
  <tr><td>Sheet</td><td>JS</td></tr>
  <tr><td>12345</td><td>67</td></tr>
</table>

<!-- this block should appear after the table HTML and the standalone script -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  var workbook = XLSX.utils.table_to_book(document.getElementById("tableau"));

  /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
</script>
```

Multiple tables on a web page can be converted to individual worksheets:

```js
/* create new workbook */
var workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();

/* convert table "table1" to worksheet named "Sheet1" */
var sheet1 = XLSX.utils.table_to_sheet(document.getElementById("table1"));
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheet1, "Sheet1");

/* convert table "table2" to worksheet named "Sheet2" */
var sheet2 = XLSX.utils.table_to_sheet(document.getElementById("table2"));
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheet2, "Sheet2");

/* workbook now has 2 worksheets */
```

Alternatively, the HTML code can be extracted and parsed:

```js
var htmlstr = document.getElementById("tableau").outerHTML;
var workbook = XLSX.read(htmlstr, {type:"string"});
```

<summary>Chrome/Chromium Extension (click to show)</summary>

The [`chrome` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/chrome/) shows a complete example and details the required permissions and other settings.

In an extension, it is recommended to generate the workbook in a content script and pass the object back to the extension:

```js
/* in the worker script */
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(msg, sender, cb) {
  /* pass a message like { sheetjs: true } from the extension to scrape */
  if(!msg || !msg.sheetjs) return;
  /* create a new workbook */
  var workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();
  /* loop through each table element */
  var tables = document.getElementsByTagName("table")
  for(var i = 0; i < tables.length; ++i) {
    var worksheet = XLSX.utils.table_to_sheet(tables[i]);
    XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, "Table" + i);
  }
  /* pass back to the extension */
  return cb(workbook);
});
```

<summary>Server-Side HTML Tables with Headless Chrome (click to show)</summary>

The [`headless` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/headless/) includes a complete demo to convert HTML files to XLSB workbooks. The core idea is to add the script to the page, parse the table in the page context, generate a `base64` workbook and send it back for further processing:

```js
const XLSX = require("xlsx");
const { readFileSync } = require("fs"), puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

const url = `https://sheetjs.com/demos/table`;

/* get the standalone build source (node_modules/xlsx/dist/xlsx.full.min.js) */
const lib = readFileSync(require.resolve("xlsx/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"), "utf8");

(async() => {
  /* start browser and go to web page */
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(url, {waitUntil: "networkidle2"});

  /* inject library */
  await page.addScriptTag({content: lib});

  /* this function `s5s` will be called by the script below, receiving the Base64-encoded file */
  await page.exposeFunction("s5s", async(b64) => {
    const workbook = XLSX.read(b64, {type: "base64" });

    /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */
  });

  /* generate XLSB file in webpage context and send back result */
  await page.addScriptTag({content: `
    /* call table_to_book on first table */
    var workbook = XLSX.utils.table_to_book(document.querySelector("TABLE"));

    /* generate XLSX file */
    var b64 = XLSX.write(workbook, {type: "base64", bookType: "xlsb"});

    /* call "s5s" hook exposed from the node process */
    window.s5s(b64);
  `});

  /* cleanup */
  await browser.close();
})();
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Server-Side HTML Tables with Headless WebKit (click to show)</summary>

The [`headless` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/headless/) includes a complete demo to convert HTML files to XLSB workbooks using [PhantomJS](https://phantomjs.org/). The core idea is to add the script to the page, parse the table in the page context, generate a `binary` workbook and send it back for further processing:

```js
var XLSX = require('xlsx');
var page = require('webpage').create();

/* this code will be run in the page */
var code = [ "function(){",
  /* call table_to_book on first table */
  "var wb = XLSX.utils.table_to_book(document.body.getElementsByTagName('table')[0]);",

  /* generate XLSB file and return binary string */
  "return XLSX.write(wb, {type: 'binary', bookType: 'xlsb'});",
"}" ].join("");

page.open('https://sheetjs.com/demos/table', function() {
  /* Load the browser script from the UNPKG CDN */
  page.includeJs("https://unpkg.com/xlsx/dist/xlsx.full.min.js", function() {
    /* The code will return an XLSB file encoded as binary string */
    var bin = page.evaluateJavaScript(code);

    var workbook = XLSX.read(bin, {type: "binary"});
    /* DO SOMETHING WITH workbook HERE */

    phantom.exit();
  });
});
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>NodeJS HTML Tables without a browser (click to show)</summary>

NodeJS does not include a DOM implementation and Puppeteer requires a hefty Chromium build. [`jsdom`](https://npm.im/jsdom) is a lightweight alternative:

```js
const XLSX = require("xlsx");
const { readFileSync } = require("fs");
const { JSDOM } = require("jsdom");

/* obtain HTML string.  This example reads from test.html */
const html_str = fs.readFileSync("test.html", "utf8");
/* get first TABLE element */
const doc = new JSDOM(html_str).window.document.querySelector("table");
/* generate workbook */
const workbook = XLSX.utils.table_to_book(doc);
```

</details>

## Processing Data

The ["Common Spreadsheet Format"](./#common-spreadsheet-format) is a simple object representation of the core concepts of a workbook. The utility functions work with the object representation and are intended to handle common use cases.

### Modifying Workbook Structure

**API**

_Append a Worksheet to a Workbook_

```js
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, sheet_name);
```

The `book_append_sheet` utility function appends a worksheet to the workbook. The third argument specifies the desired worksheet name. Multiple worksheets can be added to a workbook by calling the function multiple times. If the worksheet name is already used in the workbook, it will throw an error.

_Append a Worksheet to a Workbook and find a unique name_

```js
var new_name = XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, name, true);
```

If the fourth argument is `true`, the function will start with the specified worksheet name. If the sheet name exists in the workbook, a new worksheet name will be chosen by finding the name stem and incrementing the counter:

```js
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheetA, "Sheet2", true); // Sheet2
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheetB, "Sheet2", true); // Sheet3
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheetC, "Sheet2", true); // Sheet4
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheetD, "Sheet2", true); // Sheet5
```

_List the Worksheet names in tab order_

```js
var wsnames = workbook.SheetNames;
```

The `SheetNames` property of the workbook object is a list of the worksheet names in "tab order". API functions will look at this array.

_Replace a Worksheet in place_

```js
workbook.Sheets[sheet_name] = new_worksheet;
```

The `Sheets` property of the workbook object is an object whose keys are names and whose values are worksheet objects. By reassigning to a property of the `Sheets` object, the worksheet object can be changed without disrupting the rest of the worksheet structure.

**Examples**

<details>

<summary>Add a new worksheet to a workbook (click to show)</summary>

This example uses [`XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet`](./#array-of-arrays-input).

```js
var ws_name = "SheetJS";

/* Create worksheet */
var ws_data = [
  [ "S", "h", "e", "e", "t", "J", "S" ],
  [  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ]
];
var ws = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(ws_data);

/* Add the worksheet to the workbook */
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, ws_name);
```

</details>

### Modifying Cell Values

**API**

_Modify a single cell value in a worksheet_

```js
XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [[new_value]], { origin: address });
```

_Modify multiple cell values in a worksheet_

```js
XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, aoa, opts);
```

The `sheet_add_aoa` utility function modifies cell values in a worksheet. The first argument is the worksheet object. The second argument is an array of arrays of values. The `origin` key of the third argument controls where cells will be written. The following snippet sets `B3=1` and `E5="abc"`:

```js
XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [
  [1],                             // <-- Write 1 to cell B3
  ,                                // <-- Do nothing in row 4
  [/*B5*/, /*C5*/, /*D5*/, "abc"]  // <-- Write "abc" to cell E5
], { origin: "B3" });
```

["Array of Arrays Input"](./#array-of-arrays-input) describes the function and the optional `opts` argument in more detail.

**Examples**

<details>

<summary>Appending rows to a worksheet (click to show)</summary>

The special origin value `-1` instructs `sheet_add_aoa` to start in column A of the row after the last row in the range, appending the data:

```js
XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [
  ["first row after data", 1],
  ["second row after data", 2]
], { origin: -1 });
```

</details>

### Modifying Other Worksheet / Workbook / Cell Properties

The ["Common Spreadsheet Format"](./#common-spreadsheet-format) section describes the object structures in greater detail.

## Packaging and Releasing Data

### Writing Workbooks

**API**

_Generate spreadsheet bytes (file) from data_

```js
var data = XLSX.write(workbook, opts);
```

The `write` method attempts to package data from the workbook into a file in memory. By default, XLSX files are generated, but that can be controlled with the `bookType` property of the `opts` argument. Based on the `type` option, the data can be stored as a "binary string", JS string, `Uint8Array` or Buffer.

The second `opts` argument is required. ["Writing Options"](./#writing-options) covers the supported properties and behaviors.

_Generate and attempt to save file_

```js
XLSX.writeFile(workbook, filename, opts);
```

The `writeFile` method packages the data and attempts to save the new file. The export file format is determined by the extension of `filename` (`SheetJS.xlsx` signals XLSX export, `SheetJS.xlsb` signals XLSB export, etc).

The `writeFile` method uses platform-specific APIs to initiate the file save. In NodeJS, `fs.readFileSync` can create a file. In the web browser, a download is attempted using the HTML5 `download` attribute, with fallbacks for IE.

_Generate and attempt to save an XLSX file_

```js
XLSX.writeFileXLSX(workbook, filename, opts);
```

The `writeFile` method embeds a number of different export functions. This is great for developer experience but not amenable to tree shaking using the current developer tools. When only XLSX exports are needed, this method avoids referencing the other export functions.

The second `opts` argument is optional. ["Writing Options"](./#writing-options) covers the supported properties and behaviors.

**Examples**

<details>

<summary>Local file in a NodeJS server (click to show)</summary>

`writeFile` uses `fs.writeFileSync` in server environments:

```js
var XLSX = require("xlsx");

/* output format determined by filename */
XLSX.writeFile(workbook, "out.xlsb");
```

For Node ESM, the `writeFile` helper is not enabled. Instead, `fs.writeFileSync` should be used to write the file data to a `Buffer` for use with `XLSX.write`:

```js
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";
import { write } from "xlsx/xlsx.mjs";

const buf = write(workbook, {type: "buffer", bookType: "xlsb"});
/* buf is a Buffer */
const workbook = writeFileSync("out.xlsb", buf);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Local file in a Deno application (click to show)</summary>

`writeFile` uses `Deno.writeFileSync` under the hood:

```js
// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/sheetjs/types/index.d.ts"
import * as XLSX from 'https://deno.land/x/sheetjs/xlsx.mjs'

XLSX.writeFile(workbook, "test.xlsx");
```

Applications writing files must be invoked with the `--allow-write` flag. The [`deno` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/deno/) has more examples

</details>

<details>

<summary>Local file in a PhotoShop or InDesign plugin (click to show)</summary>

`writeFile` wraps the `File` logic in Photoshop and other ExtendScript targets. The specified path should be an absolute path:

```js
#include "xlsx.extendscript.js"

/* output format determined by filename */
XLSX.writeFile(workbook, "out.xlsx");
/* at this point, out.xlsx is a file that you can distribute */
```

The [`extendscript` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/extendscript/) includes a more complex example.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Download a file in the browser to the user machine (click to show)</summary>

`XLSX.writeFile` wraps a few techniques for triggering a file save:

* `URL` browser API creates an object URL for the file, which the library uses by creating a link and forcing a click. It is supported in modern browsers.
* `msSaveBlob` is an IE10+ API for triggering a file save.
* `IE_FileSave` uses VBScript and ActiveX to write a file in IE6+ for Windows XP and Windows 7. The shim must be included in the containing HTML page.

There is no standard way to determine if the actual file has been downloaded.

```js
/* output format determined by filename */
XLSX.writeFile(workbook, "out.xlsb");
/* at this point, out.xlsb will have been downloaded */
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Download a file in legacy browsers (click to show)</summary>

`XLSX.writeFile` techniques work for most modern browsers as well as older IE. For much older browsers, there are workarounds implemented by wrapper libraries.

[`FileSaver.js`](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) implements `saveAs`. Note: `XLSX.writeFile` will automatically call `saveAs` if available.

```js
/* bookType can be any supported output type */
var wopts = { bookType:"xlsx", bookSST:false, type:"array" };

var wbout = XLSX.write(workbook,wopts);

/* the saveAs call downloads a file on the local machine */
saveAs(new Blob([wbout],{type:"application/octet-stream"}), "test.xlsx");
```

[`Downloadify`](https://github.com/dcneiner/downloadify) uses a Flash SWF button to generate local files, suitable for environments where ActiveX is unavailable:

```js
Downloadify.create(id,{
  /* other options are required! read the downloadify docs for more info */
  filename: "test.xlsx",
  data: function() { return XLSX.write(wb, {bookType:"xlsx", type:"base64"}); },
  append: false,
  dataType: "base64"
});
```

The [`oldie` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/oldie/) shows an IE-compatible fallback scenario.

A complete example using XHR is [included in the XHR demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/xhr/), along with examples for fetch and wrapper libraries. This example assumes the server can handle Base64-encoded files (see the demo for a basic nodejs server):

```js
/* in this example, send a base64 string to the server */
var wopts = { bookType:"xlsx", bookSST:false, type:"base64" };

var wbout = XLSX.write(workbook,wopts);

var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("POST", "/upload", true);
var formdata = new FormData();
formdata.append("file", "test.xlsx"); // <-- server expects `file` to hold name
formdata.append("data", wbout); // <-- `data` holds the base64-encoded data
req.send(formdata);
```

<summary>PhantomJS (Headless Webkit) File Generation (click to show)</summary>

The [`headless` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/headless/) includes a complete demo to convert HTML files to XLSB workbooks using [PhantomJS](https://phantomjs.org/). PhantomJS `fs.write` supports writing files from the main process but has a different interface from the NodeJS `fs` module:

```js
var XLSX = require('xlsx');
var fs = require('fs');

/* generate a binary string */
var bin = XLSX.write(workbook, { type:"binary", bookType: "xlsx" });
/* write to file */
fs.write("test.xlsx", bin, "wb");
```

Note: The section ["Processing HTML Tables"](./#processing-html-tables) shows how to generate a workbook from HTML tables in a page in "Headless WebKit".

</details>

The [included demos](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/) cover mobile apps and other special deployments.

### Writing Examples

* [http://sheetjs.com/demos/table.html](http://sheetjs.com/demos/table.html) exporting an HTML table
* [http://sheetjs.com/demos/writexlsx.html](http://sheetjs.com/demos/writexlsx.html) generates a simple file

### Streaming Write

The streaming write functions are available in the `XLSX.stream` object. They take the same arguments as the normal write functions but return a NodeJS Readable Stream.

* `XLSX.stream.to_csv` is the streaming version of `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_csv`.
* `XLSX.stream.to_html` is the streaming version of `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html`.
* `XLSX.stream.to_json` is the streaming version of `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json`.

<summary>Exporting NUMBERS files (click to show)</summary>

The NUMBERS writer requires a fairly large base. The supplementary `xlsx.zahl` scripts provide support. `xlsx.zahl.js` is designed for standalone and NodeJS use, while `xlsx.zahl.mjs` is suitable for ESM.

_Browser_

```html
<meta charset="utf8">
<script src="xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
<script src="xlsx.zahl.js"></script>
<script>
var wb = XLSX.utils.book_new(); var ws = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([
  ["SheetJS", "<3","விரிதாள்"],
  [72,,"Arbeitsblätter"],
  [,62,"数据"],
  [true,false,],
]); XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, "Sheet1");
XLSX.writeFile(wb, "textport.numbers", {numbers: XLSX_ZAHL, compression: true});
</script>
```

_Node_

```js
var XLSX = require("./xlsx.flow");
var XLSX_ZAHL = require("./dist/xlsx.zahl");
var wb = XLSX.utils.book_new(); var ws = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([
  ["SheetJS", "<3","விரிதாள்"],
  [72,,"Arbeitsblätter"],
  [,62,"数据"],
  [true,false,],

### Generating JSON and JS Data

JSON and JS data tend to represent single worksheets. The utility functions in this section work with single worksheets.

The ["Common Spreadsheet Format"](./#common-spreadsheet-format) section describes the object structure in more detail. `workbook.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the worksheet names. `workbook.Sheets` is an object whose keys are sheet names and whose values are worksheet objects.

The "first worksheet" is stored at `workbook.Sheets[workbook.SheetNames[0]]`.

**API**

_Create an array of JS objects from a worksheet_

```js
var jsa = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, opts);
```

_Create an array of arrays of JS values from a worksheet_

```js
var aoa = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, {...opts, header: 1});
```

The `sheet_to_json` utility function walks a workbook in row-major order, generating an array of objects. The second `opts` argument controls a number of export decisions including the type of values (JS values or formatted text). The ["JSON"](./#json) section describes the argument in more detail.

By default, `sheet_to_json` scans the first row and uses the values as headers. With the `header: 1` option, the function exports an array of arrays of values.

**Examples**

[`x-spreadsheet`](https://github.com/myliang/x-spreadsheet) is an interactive data grid for previewing and modifying structured data in the web browser. The [`xspreadsheet` demo](../../../demos/xspreadsheet/) includes a sample script with the `stox` function for converting from a workbook to x-spreadsheet data object. [https://oss.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/x-spreadsheet](https://oss.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/x-spreadsheet) is a live demo.

<summary>Previewing data in a React data grid (click to show)</summary>

[`react-data-grid`](https://npm.im/react-data-grid) is a data grid tailored for react. It expects two properties: `rows` of data objects and `columns` which describe the columns. For the purposes of massaging the data to fit the react data grid API it is easiest to start from an array of arrays.

This demo starts by fetching a remote file and using `XLSX.read` to extract:

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import DataGrid from "react-data-grid";
import { read, utils } from "xlsx";

const url = "https://oss.sheetjs.com/test_files/RkNumber.xls";

export default function App() {
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState([]);
  const [rows, setRows] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {(async () => {
    const wb = read(await (await fetch(url)).arrayBuffer(), { WTF: 1 });

    /* use sheet_to_json with header: 1 to generate an array of arrays */
    const data = utils.sheet_to_json(wb.Sheets[wb.SheetNames[0]], { header: 1 });

    /* see react-data-grid docs to understand the shape of the expected data */
    setColumns(data[0].map((r) => ({ key: r, name: r })));
    setRows(data.slice(1).map((r) => r.reduce((acc, x, i) => {
      acc[data[0][i]] = x;
      return acc;
    }, {})));
  })(); });

  return <DataGrid columns={columns} rows={rows} />;
}

<summary>Numerical Computations with TensorFlow.js (click to show)</summary>

[`@tensorflow/tfjs`](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/@tensorflow/tfjs/) and other libraries expect data in simple arrays, well-suited for worksheets where each column is a data vector. That is the transpose of how most people use spreadsheets, where each row is a vector.

A single `Array#map` can pull individual named rows from `sheet_to_json` export:

```js
const XLSX = require("xlsx");
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

const key = "age"; // this is the field we want to pull
const ages = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet).map(r => r[key]);
const tf_data = tf.tensor1d(ages);
```

All fields can be processed at once using a transpose of the 2D tensor generated with the `sheet_to_json` export with `header: 1`. The first row, if it contains header labels, should be removed with a slice:

```js
const XLSX = require("xlsx");
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

/* array of arrays of the data starting on the second row */
const aoa = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, {header: 1}).slice(1);
/* dataset in the "correct orientation" */
const tf_dataset = tf.tensor2d(aoa).transpose();
/* pull out each dataset with a slice */
const tf_field0 = tf_dataset.slice([0,0], [1,tensor.shape[1]]).flatten();
const tf_field1 = tf_dataset.slice([1,0], [1,tensor.shape[1]]).flatten();
```

The [`array` demo](../../../11.%20Maps/node\_modules/xlsx/demos/array/) shows a complete example.

</details>

### Generating HTML Tables

**API**

_Generate HTML Table from Worksheet_

```js
var html = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html(worksheet);
```

The `sheet_to_html` utility function generates HTML code based on the worksheet data. Each cell in the worksheet is mapped to a `<TD>` element. Merged cells in the worksheet are serialized by setting `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes.

**Examples**

The `sheet_to_html` utility function generates HTML code that can be added to any DOM element by setting the `innerHTML`:

```js
var container = document.getElementById("tavolo");
container.innerHTML = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html(worksheet);
```

Combining with `fetch`, constructing a site from a workbook is straightforward:

  <script type="text/javascript">
(async() => {
  /* fetch and parse workbook -- see the fetch example for details */
  const workbook = XLSX.read(await (await fetch("sheetjs.xlsx")).arrayBuffer());

  let output = [];
  /* loop through the worksheet names in order */
  workbook.SheetNames.forEach(name => {

    /* generate HTML from the corresponding worksheets */
    const worksheet = workbook.Sheets[name];
    const html = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html(worksheet);

    /* add a header with the title name followed by the table */
    output.push(`<H3>${name}</H3>${html}`);
  });
  /* write to the DOM at the end */
  tavolo.innerHTML = output.join("\n");
})();
  </script>
</body>
```

<summary>React fetch workbook and generate HTML table previews (click to show)</summary>

It is generally recommended to use a React-friendly workflow, but it is possible to generate HTML and use it in React with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:

```jsx
function Tabeller(props) {
  /* the workbook object is the state */
  const [workbook, setWorkbook] = React.useState(XLSX.utils.book_new());

  /* fetch and update the workbook with an effect */
  React.useEffect(() => { (async() => {
    /* fetch and parse workbook -- see the fetch example for details */
    const wb = XLSX.read(await (await fetch("sheetjs.xlsx")).arrayBuffer());
    setWorkbook(wb);
  })(); });

  return workbook.SheetNames.map(name => (<>
    <h3>name</h3>
    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      /* this __html mantra is needed to set the inner HTML */
      __html: XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html(workbook.Sheets[name])
    }} />
  </>));
}
```

<summary>VueJS fetch workbook and generate HTML table previews (click to show)</summary>

It is generally recommended to use a VueJS-friendly workflow, but it is possible to generate HTML and use it in VueJS with the `v-html` directive:

import { reactive } from 'vue';

const S5SComponent = {
  mounted() { (async() => {
    /* fetch and parse workbook -- see the fetch example for details */
    const workbook = read(await (await fetch("sheetjs.xlsx")).arrayBuffer());
    /* loop through the worksheet names in order */
    workbook.SheetNames.forEach(name => {
      /* generate HTML from the corresponding worksheets */
      const html = utils.sheet_to_html(workbook.Sheets[name]);
      /* add to state */
      this.wb.wb.push({ name, html });
    });
  })(); },
  /* this state mantra is required for array updates to work */
  setup() { return { wb: reactive({ wb: [] }) }; },
  template: `
  <div v-for="ws in wb.wb" :key="ws.name">
    <h3>{{ ws.name }}</h3>

### Generating Single-Worksheet Snapshots

The `sheet_to_*` functions accept a worksheet object.

**API**

_Generate a CSV from a single worksheet_

```js
var csv = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_csv(worksheet, opts);
```

This snapshot is designed to replicate the "CSV UTF8 (`.csv`)" output type. ["Delimiter-Separated Output"](./#delimiter-separated-output) describes the function and the optional `opts` argument in more detail.

_Generate "Text" from a single worksheet_

```js
var txt = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_txt(worksheet, opts);
```

This snapshot is designed to replicate the "UTF16 Text (`.txt`)" output type. ["Delimiter-Separated Output"](./#delimiter-separated-output) describes the function and the optional `opts` argument in more detail.

_Generate a list of formulae from a single worksheet_

```js
var fmla = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_formulae(worksheet);
```

This snapshot generates an array of entries representing the embedded formulae. Array formulae are rendered in the form `range=formula` while plain cells are rendered in the form `cell=formula or value`. String literals are prefixed with an apostrophe `'`, consistent with Excel's formula bar display.

["Formulae Output"](./#formulae-output) describes the function in more detail.

## Interface

`XLSX` is the exposed variable in the browser and the exported node variable

`XLSX.version` is the version of the library (added by the build script).

`XLSX.SSF` is an embedded version of the [format library](https://git.io/ssf).

### Parsing functions

`XLSX.read(data, read_opts)` attempts to parse `data`.

`XLSX.readFile(filename, read_opts)` attempts to read `filename` and parse.

Parse options are described in the [Parsing Options](./#parsing-options) section.

### Writing functions

`XLSX.write(wb, write_opts)` attempts to write the workbook `wb`

`XLSX.writeFile(wb, filename, write_opts)` attempts to write `wb` to `filename`. In browser-based environments, it will attempt to force a client-side download.

`XLSX.writeFileAsync(wb, filename, o, cb)` attempts to write `wb` to `filename`. If `o` is omitted, the writer will use the third argument as the callback.

`XLSX.stream` contains a set of streaming write functions.

Write options are described in the [Writing Options](./#writing-options) section.

### Utilities

Utilities are available in the `XLSX.utils` object and are described in the [Utility Functions](./#utility-functions) section:

**Constructing:**

* `book_new` creates an empty workbook
* `book_append_sheet` adds a worksheet to a workbook

**Importing:**

* `aoa_to_sheet` converts an array of arrays of JS data to a worksheet.
* `json_to_sheet` converts an array of JS objects to a worksheet.
* `table_to_sheet` converts a DOM TABLE element to a worksheet.
* `sheet_add_aoa` adds an array of arrays of JS data to an existing worksheet.
* `sheet_add_json` adds an array of JS objects to an existing worksheet.

**Exporting:**

* `sheet_to_json` converts a worksheet object to an array of JSON objects.
* `sheet_to_csv` generates delimiter-separated-values output.
* `sheet_to_txt` generates UTF16 formatted text.
* `sheet_to_html` generates HTML output.
* `sheet_to_formulae` generates a list of the formulae (with value fallbacks).

**Cell and cell address manipulation:**

* `format_cell` generates the text value for a cell (using number formats).
* `encode_row / decode_row` converts between 0-indexed rows and 1-indexed rows.
* `encode_col / decode_col` converts between 0-indexed columns and column names.
* `encode_cell / decode_cell` converts cell addresses.
* `encode_range / decode_range` converts cell ranges.

## Common Spreadsheet Format

SheetJS conforms to the Common Spreadsheet Format (CSF):

### General Structures

Cell address objects are stored as `{c:C, r:R}` where `C` and `R` are 0-indexed column and row numbers, respectively. For example, the cell address `B5` is represented by the object `{c:1, r:4}`.

Cell range objects are stored as `{s:S, e:E}` where `S` is the first cell and `E` is the last cell in the range. The ranges are inclusive. For example, the range `A3:B7` is represented by the object `{s:{c:0, r:2}, e:{c:1, r:6}}`. Utility functions perform a row-major order walk traversal of a sheet range:

```js
for(var R = range.s.r; R <= range.e.r; ++R) {
  for(var C = range.s.c; C <= range.e.c; ++C) {
    var cell_address = {c:C, r:R};
    /* if an A1-style address is needed, encode the address */
    var cell_ref = XLSX.utils.encode_cell(cell_address);
  }
}
```

### Cell Object

Cell objects are plain JS objects with keys and values following the convention:

| Key | Description                                                            |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `v` | raw value (see Data Types section for more info)                       |
| `w` | formatted text (if applicable)                                         |
| `t` | type: `b` Boolean, `e` Error, `n` Number, `d` Date, `s` Text, `z` Stub |
| `f` | cell formula encoded as an A1-style string (if applicable)             |
| `F` | range of enclosing array if formula is array formula (if applicable)   |
| `D` | if true, array formula is dynamic (if applicable)                      |
| `r` | rich text encoding (if applicable)                                     |
| `h` | HTML rendering of the rich text (if applicable)                        |
| `c` | comments associated with the cell                                      |
| `z` | number format string associated with the cell (if requested)           |
| `l` | cell hyperlink object (`.Target` holds link, `.Tooltip` is tooltip)    |
| `s` | the style/theme of the cell (if applicable)                            |

Built-in export utilities (such as the CSV exporter) will use the `w` text if it is available. To change a value, be sure to delete `cell.w` (or set it to `undefined`) before attempting to export. The utilities will regenerate the `w` text from the number format (`cell.z`) and the raw value if possible.

The actual array formula is stored in the `f` field of the first cell in the array range. Other cells in the range will omit the `f` field.

#### Data Types

The raw value is stored in the `v` value property, interpreted based on the `t` type property. This separation allows for representation of numbers as well as numeric text. There are 6 valid cell types:

| Type | Description                                                             |
| :--: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `b` | Boolean: value interpreted as JS `boolean`                              |
|  `e` | Error: value is a numeric code and `w` property stores common name \*\* |
|  `n` | Number: value is a JS `number` \*\*                                     |
|  `d` | Date: value is a JS `Date` object or string to be parsed as Date \*\*   |
|  `s` | Text: value interpreted as JS `string` and written as text \*\*         |
|  `z` | Stub: blank stub cell that is ignored by data processing utilities \*\* |

<details>

<summary>Error values and interpretation (click to show)</summary>



</details>

Type `n` is the Number type. This includes all forms of data that Excel stores as numbers, such as dates/times and Boolean fields. Excel exclusively uses data that can be fit in an IEEE754 floating point number, just like JS Number, so the `v` field holds the raw number. The `w` field holds formatted text. Dates are stored as numbers by default and converted with `XLSX.SSF.parse_date_code`.

Type `d` is the Date type, generated only when the option `cellDates` is passed. Since JSON does not have a natural Date type, parsers are generally expected to store ISO 8601 Date strings like you would get from `date.toISOString()`. On the other hand, writers and exporters should be able to handle date strings and JS Date objects. Note that Excel disregards timezone modifiers and treats all dates in the local timezone. The library does not correct for this error.

Type `s` is the String type. Values are explicitly stored as text. Excel will interpret these cells as "number stored as text". Generated Excel files automatically suppress that class of error, but other formats may elicit errors.

Type `z` represents blank stub cells. They are generated in cases where cells have no assigned value but hold comments or other metadata. They are ignored by the core library data processing utility functions. By default these cells are not generated; the parser `sheetStubs` option must be set to `true`.

#### Dates

<details>

<summary>Excel Date Code details (click to show)</summary>

By default, Excel stores dates as numbers with a format code that specifies date processing. For example, the date `19-Feb-17` is stored as the number `42785` with a number format of `d-mmm-yy`. The `SSF` module understands number formats and performs the appropriate conversion.

XLSX also supports a special date type `d` where the data is an ISO 8601 date string. The formatter converts the date back to a number.

The default behavior for all parsers is to generate number cells. Setting `cellDates` to true will force the generators to store dates.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Time Zones and Dates (click to show)</summary>

Excel has no native concept of universal time. All times are specified in the local time zone. Excel limitations prevent specifying true absolute dates.

Following Excel, this library treats all dates as relative to local time zone.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Epochs: 1900 and 1904 (click to show)</summary>

Excel supports two epochs (January 1 1900 and January 1 1904). The workbook's epoch can be determined by examining the workbook's `wb.Workbook.WBProps.date1904` property:

```js
!!(((wb.Workbook||{}).WBProps||{}).date1904)
```

</details>

### Sheet Objects

Each key that does not start with `!` maps to a cell (using `A-1` notation)

`sheet[address]` returns the cell object for the specified address.

**Special sheet keys (accessible as `sheet[key]`, each starting with `!`):**

*   `sheet['!ref']`: A-1 based range representing the sheet range. Functions that work with sheets should use this parameter to determine the range. Cells that are assigned outside of the range are not processed. In particular, when writing a sheet by hand, cells outside of the range are not included

    Functions that handle sheets should test for the presence of `!ref` field. If the `!ref` is omitted or is not a valid range, functions are free to treat the sheet as empty or attempt to guess the range. The standard utilities that ship with this library treat sheets as empty (for example, the CSV output is empty string).

    When reading a worksheet with the `sheetRows` property set, the ref parameter will use the restricted range. The original range is set at `ws['!fullref']`
* `sheet['!margins']`: Object representing the page margins. The default values follow Excel's "normal" preset. Excel also has a "wide" and a "narrow" preset but they are stored as raw measurements. The main properties are listed below:

<details>

<summary>Page margin details (click to show)</summary>

```js
/* Set worksheet sheet to "normal" */
ws["!margins"]={left:0.7, right:0.7, top:0.75,bottom:0.75,header:0.3,footer:0.3}
/* Set worksheet sheet to "wide" */
ws["!margins"]={left:1.0, right:1.0, top:1.0, bottom:1.0, header:0.5,footer:0.5}
/* Set worksheet sheet to "narrow" */
ws["!margins"]={left:0.25,right:0.25,top:0.75,bottom:0.75,header:0.3,footer:0.3}
```

</details>

#### Worksheet Object

In addition to the base sheet keys, worksheets also add:

* `ws['!cols']`: array of column properties objects. Column widths are actually stored in files in a normalized manner, measured in terms of the "Maximum Digit Width" (the largest width of the rendered digits 0-9, in pixels). When parsed, the column objects store the pixel width in the `wpx` field, character width in the `wch` field, and the maximum digit width in the `MDW` field.
* `ws['!rows']`: array of row properties objects as explained later in the docs. Each row object encodes properties including row height and visibility.
* `ws['!merges']`: array of range objects corresponding to the merged cells in the worksheet. Plain text formats do not support merge cells. CSV export will write all cells in the merge range if they exist, so be sure that only the first cell (upper-left) in the range is set.
* `ws['!outline']`: configure how outlines should behave. Options default to the default settings in Excel 2019:

| key     | Excel feature                                 | default |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `above` | Uncheck "Summary rows below detail"           | `false` |
| `left`  | Uncheck "Summary rows to the right of detail" | `false` |

* `ws['!protect']`: object of write sheet protection properties. The `password` key specifies the password for formats that support password-protected sheets (XLSX/XLSB/XLS). The writer uses the XOR obfuscation method. The following keys control the sheet protection -- set to `false` to enable a feature when sheet is locked or set to `true` to disable a feature:

<details>

<summary>Worksheet Protection Details (click to show)</summary>

* `ws['!autofilter']`: AutoFilter object following the schema:

```typescript
type AutoFilter = {
  ref:string; // A-1 based range representing the AutoFilter table range
}
```

**Chartsheet Object**

Chartsheets are represented as standard sheets. They are distinguished with the `!type` property set to `"chart"`.

The underlying data and `!ref` refer to the cached data in the chartsheet. The first row of the chartsheet is the underlying header.

**Macrosheet Object**

Macrosheets are represented as standard sheets. They are distinguished with the `!type` property set to `"macro"`.

**Dialogsheet Object**

Dialogsheets are represented as standard sheets. They are distinguished with the `!type` property set to `"dialog"`.

#### Workbook Object

`workbook.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the sheets in the workbook

`wb.Sheets[sheetname]` returns an object representing the worksheet.

`wb.Props` is an object storing the standard properties. `wb.Custprops` stores custom properties. Since the XLS standard properties deviate from the XLSX standard, XLS parsing stores core properties in both places.

`wb.Workbook` stores [workbook-level attributes](./#workbook-level-attributes).

**Workbook File Properties**

The various file formats use different internal names for file properties. The workbook `Props` object normalizes the names:

For example, to set the workbook title property:

```js
if(!wb.Props) wb.Props = {};
wb.Props.Title = "Insert Title Here";
```

Custom properties are added in the workbook `Custprops` object:

```js
if(!wb.Custprops) wb.Custprops = {};
wb.Custprops["Custom Property"] = "Custom Value";
```

Writers will process the `Props` key of the options object:

```js
/* force the Author to be "SheetJS" */
XLSX.write(wb, {Props:{Author:"SheetJS"}});
```

#### Workbook-Level Attributes

`wb.Workbook` stores workbook-level attributes.

**Defined Names**

`wb.Workbook.Names` is an array of defined name objects which have the keys:

Excel allows two sheet-scoped defined names to share the same name. However, a sheet-scoped name cannot collide with a workbook-scope name. Workbook writers may not enforce this constraint.

**Workbook Views**

`wb.Workbook.Views` is an array of workbook view objects which have the keys:

**Miscellaneous Workbook Properties**

`wb.Workbook.WBProps` holds other workbook properties:

#### Document Features

Even for basic features like date storage, the official Excel formats store the same content in different ways. The parsers are expected to convert from the underlying file format representation to the Common Spreadsheet Format. Writers are expected to convert from CSF back to the underlying file format.

**Formulae**

The A1-style formula string is stored in the `f` field. Even though different file formats store the formulae in different ways, the formats are translated. Even though some formats store formulae with a leading equal sign, CSF formulae do not start with `=`.

**Single-Cell Formulae**

For simple formulae, the `f` key of the desired cell can be set to the actual formula text. This worksheet represents `A1=1`, `A2=2`, and `A3=A1+A2`:

```js
var worksheet = {
  "!ref": "A1:A3",
  A1: { t:'n', v:1 },
  A2: { t:'n', v:2 },
  A3: { t:'n', v:3, f:'A1+A2' }
};
```

Utilities like `aoa_to_sheet` will accept cell objects in lieu of values:

```js
var worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([
  [ 1 ], // A1
  [ 2 ], // A2
  [ {t: "n", v: 3, f: "A1+A2"} ] // A3
]);
```

Cells with formula entries but no value will be serialized in a way that Excel and other spreadsheet tools will recognize. This library will not automatically compute formula results! For example, the following worksheet will include the `BESSELJ` function but the result will not be available in JavaScript:

```js
var worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([
  [ 3.14159, 2 ], // Row "1"
  [ { t:'n', f:'BESSELJ(A1,B1)' } ] // Row "2" will be calculated on file open
}
```

If the actual results are needed in JS, [SheetJS Pro](https://sheetjs.com/pro) offers a formula calculator component for evaluating expressions, updating values and dependent cells, and refreshing entire workbooks.

**Array Formulae**

_Assign an array formula_

```js
XLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, range, formula);
```

Array formulae are stored in the top-left cell of the array block. All cells of an array formula have a `F` field corresponding to the range. A single-cell formula can be distinguished from a plain formula by the presence of `F` field.

For example, setting the cell `C1` to the array formula `{=SUM(A1:A3*B1:B3)}`:

```js
// API function
XLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, "C1", "SUM(A1:A3*B1:B3)");

// ... OR raw operations
worksheet['C1'] = { t:'n', f: "SUM(A1:A3*B1:B3)", F:"C1:C1" };
```

For a multi-cell array formula, every cell has the same array range but only the first cell specifies the formula. Consider `D1:D3=A1:A3*B1:B3`:

```js
// API function
XLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, "D1:D3", "A1:A3*B1:B3");

// ... OR raw operations
worksheet['D1'] = { t:'n', F:"D1:D3", f:"A1:A3*B1:B3" };
worksheet['D2'] = { t:'n', F:"D1:D3" };
worksheet['D3'] = { t:'n', F:"D1:D3" };
```

Utilities and writers are expected to check for the presence of a `F` field and ignore any possible formula element `f` in cells other than the starting cell. They are not expected to perform validation of the formulae!

**Dynamic Array Formulae**

_Assign a dynamic array formula_

```js
XLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, range, formula, true);
```

Released in 2020, Dynamic Array Formulae are supported in the XLSX/XLSM and XLSB file formats. They are represented like normal array formulae but have special cell metadata indicating that the formula should be allowed to adjust the range.

An array formula can be marked as dynamic by setting the cell's `D` property to true. The `F` range is expected but can be the set to the current cell:

```js
// API function
XLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, "C1", "_xlfn.UNIQUE(A1:A3)", 1);

// ... OR raw operations
worksheet['C1'] = { t: "s", f: "_xlfn.UNIQUE(A1:A3)", F:"C1", D: 1 }; // dynamic
```

**Localization with Function Names**

SheetJS operates at the file level. Excel stores formula expressions using the English (United States) function names. For non-English users, Excel uses a localized set of function names.

For example, when the computer language and region is set to French (France), Excel interprets `=SOMME(A1:C3)` as if `SOMME` is the `SUM` function. However, in the actual file, Excel stores `SUM(A1:C3)`.

**Prefixed "Future Functions"**

Functions introduced in newer versions of Excel are prefixed with `_xlfn.` when stored in files. When writing formula expressions using these functions, the prefix is required for maximal compatibility:

```js
// Broadest compatibility
XLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, "C1", "_xlfn.UNIQUE(A1:A3)", 1);

// Can cause errors in spreadsheet software
XLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, "C1", "UNIQUE(A1:A3)", 1);
```

When reading a file, the `xlfn` option preserves the prefixes.

**Row and Column Properties**

Row and Column properties are not extracted by default when reading from a file and are not persisted by default when writing to a file. The option `cellStyles: true` must be passed to the relevant read or write function.

_Column Properties_

The `!cols` array in each worksheet, if present, is a collection of `ColInfo` objects which have the following properties:

```typescript
type ColInfo = {
  /* visibility */
  hidden?: boolean; // if true, the column is hidden

  /* column width is specified in one of the following ways: */
  wpx?:    number;  // width in screen pixels
  width?:  number;  // width in Excel's "Max Digit Width", width*256 is integral
  wch?:    number;  // width in characters

  /* other fields for preserving features from files */
  level?:  number;  // 0-indexed outline / group level
  MDW?:    number;  // Excel's "Max Digit Width" unit, always integral
};
```

_Row Properties_

The `!rows` array in each worksheet, if present, is a collection of `RowInfo` objects which have the following properties:

```typescript
type RowInfo = {
  /* visibility */
  hidden?: boolean; // if true, the row is hidden

  /* row height is specified in one of the following ways: */
  hpx?:    number;  // height in screen pixels
  hpt?:    number;  // height in points

  level?:  number;  // 0-indexed outline / group level
};
```

_Outline / Group Levels Convention_

The Excel UI displays the base outline level as `1` and the max level as `8`. Following JS conventions, SheetJS uses 0-indexed outline levels wherein the base outline level is `0` and the max level is `7`.

**Number Formats**

The `cell.w` formatted text for each cell is produced from `cell.v` and `cell.z` format. If the format is not specified, the Excel `General` format is used. The format can either be specified as a string or as an index into the format table. Parsers are expected to populate `workbook.SSF` with the number format table. Writers are expected to serialize the table.

Custom tools should ensure that the local table has each used format string somewhere in the table. Excel convention mandates that the custom formats start at index 164. The following example creates a custom format from scratch:

The rules are slightly different from how Excel displays custom number formats. In particular, literal characters must be wrapped in double quotes or preceded by a backslash. For more info, see the Excel documentation article `Create or delete a custom number format` or ECMA-376 18.8.31 (Number Formats)

Format 14 (`m/d/yy`) is localized by Excel: even though the file specifies that number format, it will be drawn differently based on system settings. It makes sense when the producer and consumer of files are in the same locale, but that is not always the case over the Internet. To get around this ambiguity, parse functions accept the `dateNF` option to override the interpretation of that specific format string.

**Hyperlinks**

Hyperlinks are stored in the `l` key of cell objects. The `Target` field of the hyperlink object is the target of the link, including the URI fragment. Tooltips are stored in the `Tooltip` field and are displayed when you move your mouse over the text.

For example, the following snippet creates a link from cell `A3` to [https://sheetjs.com](https://sheetjs.com) with the tip `"Find us @ SheetJS.com!"`:

```js
ws['A1'].l = { Target:"https://sheetjs.com", Tooltip:"Find us @ SheetJS.com!" };
```

Note that Excel does not automatically style hyperlinks -- they will generally be displayed as normal text.

_Remote Links_

HTTP / HTTPS links can be used directly:

```js
ws['A2'].l = { Target:"https://docs.sheetjs.com/#hyperlinks" };
ws['A3'].l = { Target:"http://localhost:7262/yes_localhost_works" };
```

Excel also supports `mailto` email links with subject line:

```js
ws['A4'].l = { Target:"mailto:ignored@dev.null" };
ws['A5'].l = { Target:"mailto:ignored@dev.null?subject=Test Subject" };
```

_Local Links_

Links to absolute paths should use the `file://` URI scheme:

```js
ws['B1'].l = { Target:"file:///SheetJS/t.xlsx" }; /* Link to /SheetJS/t.xlsx */
ws['B2'].l = { Target:"file:///c:/SheetJS.xlsx" }; /* Link to c:\SheetJS.xlsx */
```

Links to relative paths can be specified without a scheme:

```js
ws['B3'].l = { Target:"SheetJS.xlsb" }; /* Link to SheetJS.xlsb */
ws['B4'].l = { Target:"../SheetJS.xlsm" }; /* Link to ../SheetJS.xlsm */
```

Relative Paths have undefined behavior in the SpreadsheetML 2003 format. Excel 2019 will treat a `..\` parent mark as two levels up.

_Internal Links_

Links where the target is a cell or range or defined name in the same workbook ("Internal Links") are marked with a leading hash character:

```js
ws['C1'].l = { Target:"#E2" }; /* Link to cell E2 */
ws['C2'].l = { Target:"#Sheet2!E2" }; /* Link to cell E2 in sheet Sheet2 */
ws['C3'].l = { Target:"#SomeDefinedName" }; /* Link to Defined Name */
```

**Cell Comments**

Cell comments are objects stored in the `c` array of cell objects. The actual contents of the comment are split into blocks based on the comment author. The `a` field of each comment object is the author of the comment and the `t` field is the plain text representation.

For example, the following snippet appends a cell comment into cell `A1`:

```js
if(!ws.A1.c) ws.A1.c = [];
ws.A1.c.push({a:"SheetJS", t:"I'm a little comment, short and stout!"});
```

Note: XLSB enforces a 54 character limit on the Author name. Names longer than 54 characters may cause issues with other formats.

To mark a comment as normally hidden, set the `hidden` property:

```js
if(!ws.A1.c) ws.A1.c = [];
ws.A1.c.push({a:"SheetJS", t:"This comment is visible"});

if(!ws.A2.c) ws.A2.c = [];
ws.A2.c.hidden = true;
ws.A2.c.push({a:"SheetJS", t:"This comment will be hidden"});
```

_Threaded Comments_

Introduced in Excel 365, threaded comments are plain text comment snippets with author metadata and parent references. They are supported in XLSX and XLSB.

To mark a comment as threaded, each comment part must have a true `T` property:

```js
if(!ws.A1.c) ws.A1.c = [];
ws.A1.c.push({a:"SheetJS", t:"This is not threaded"});

if(!ws.A2.c) ws.A2.c = [];
ws.A2.c.hidden = true;
ws.A2.c.push({a:"SheetJS", t:"This is threaded", T: true});
ws.A2.c.push({a:"JSSheet", t:"This is also threaded", T: true});
```

There is no Active Directory or Office 365 metadata associated with authors in a thread.

**Sheet Visibility**

Excel enables hiding sheets in the lower tab bar. The sheet data is stored in the file but the UI does not readily make it available. Standard hidden sheets are revealed in the "Unhide" menu. Excel also has "very hidden" sheets which cannot be revealed in the menu. It is only accessible in the VB Editor!

The visibility setting is stored in the `Hidden` property of sheet props array.

**VBA and Macros**

VBA Macros are stored in a special data blob that is exposed in the `vbaraw` property of the workbook object when the `bookVBA` option is `true`. They are supported in `XLSM`, `XLSB`, and `BIFF8 XLS` formats. The supported format writers automatically insert the data blobs if it is present in the workbook and associate with the worksheet names.

### Parsing Options

The exported `read` and `readFile` functions accept an options argument:

* Even if `cellNF` is false, formatted text will be generated and saved to `.w`
* In some cases, sheets may be parsed even if `bookSheets` is false.
* Excel aggressively tries to interpret values from CSV and other plain text. This leads to surprising behavior! The `raw` option suppresses value parsing.
* `bookSheets` and `bookProps` combine to give both sets of information
* `Deps` will be an empty object if `bookDeps` is false
* `bookFiles` behavior depends on file type:
  * `keys` array (paths in the ZIP) for ZIP-based formats
  * `files` hash (mapping paths to objects representing the files) for ZIP
  * `cfb` object for formats using CFB containers
* `sheetRows-1` rows will be generated when looking at the JSON object output (since the header row is counted as a row when parsing the data)
* By default all worksheets are parsed. `sheets` restricts based on input type:
  * number: zero-based index of worksheet to parse (`0` is first worksheet)
  * string: name of worksheet to parse (case insensitive)
  * array of numbers and strings to select multiple worksheets.
* `bookVBA` merely exposes the raw VBA CFB object. It does not parse the data. XLSM and XLSB store the VBA CFB object in `xl/vbaProject.bin`. BIFF8 XLS mixes the VBA entries alongside the core Workbook entry, so the library generates a new XLSB-compatible blob from the XLS CFB container.
* `codepage` is applied to BIFF2 - BIFF5 files without `CodePage` records and to CSV files without BOM in `type:"binary"`. BIFF8 XLS always defaults to 1200.
* `PRN` affects parsing of text files without a common delimiter character.
* Currently only XOR encryption is supported. Unsupported error will be thrown for files employing other encryption methods.
* Newer Excel functions are serialized with the `_xlfn.` prefix, hidden from the user. SheetJS will strip `_xlfn.` normally. The `xlfn` option preserves them.
* WTF is mainly for development. By default, the parser will suppress read errors on single worksheets, allowing you to read from the worksheets that do parse properly. Setting `WTF:true` forces those errors to be thrown.

#### Input Type

Strings can be interpreted in multiple ways. The `type` parameter for `read` tells the library how to parse the data argument:

#### Guessing File Type

### Writing Options

The exported `write` and `writeFile` functions accept an options argument:

* `bookSST` is slower and more memory intensive, but has better compatibility with older versions of iOS Numbers
* The raw data is the only thing guaranteed to be saved. Features not described in this README may not be serialized.
* `cellDates` only applies to XLSX output and is not guaranteed to work with third-party readers. Excel itself does not usually write cells with type `d` so non-Excel tools may ignore the data or error in the presence of dates.
* `Props` is an object mirroring the workbook `Props` field. See the table from the [Workbook File Properties](./#workbook-file-properties) section.
* if specified, the string from `themeXLSX` will be saved as the primary theme for XLSX/XLSB/XLSM files (to `xl/theme/theme1.xml` in the ZIP)
* Due to a bug in the program, some features like "Text to Columns" will crash Excel on worksheets where error conditions are ignored. The writer will mark files to ignore the error by default. Set `ignoreEC` to `false` to suppress.
* Due to the size of the data, the NUMBERS data is not included by default. The included `xlsx.zahl.js` and `xlsx.zahl.mjs` scripts include the data.

#### Supported Output Formats

For broad compatibility with third-party tools, this library supports many output formats. The specific file type is controlled with `bookType` option:

* `compression` only applies to formats with ZIP containers.
* Formats that only support a single sheet require a `sheet` option specifying the worksheet. If the string is empty, the first worksheet is used.
* `writeFile` will automatically guess the output file format based on the file extension if `bookType` is not specified. It will choose the first format in the aforementioned table that matches the extension.

#### Output Type

The `type` argument for `write` mirrors the `type` argument for `read`:

* For compatibility with Excel, `csv` output will always include the UTF-8 byte order mark.

### Utility Functions

The `sheet_to_*` functions accept a worksheet and an optional options object.

The `*_to_sheet` functions accept a data object and an optional options object.

The examples are based on the following worksheet:

```
XXX| A | B | C | D | E | F | G |
---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 1 | S | h | e | e | t | J | S |
 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
```

#### Array of Arrays Input

`XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet` takes an array of arrays of JS values and returns a worksheet resembling the input data. Numbers, Booleans and Strings are stored as the corresponding styles. Dates are stored as date or numbers. Array holes and explicit `undefined` values are skipped. `null` values may be stubbed. All other values are stored as strings. The function takes an options argument:

`XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa` takes an array of arrays of JS values and updates an existing worksheet object. It follows the same process as `aoa_to_sheet` and accepts an options argument:

`origin` is expected to be one of:

#### Array of Objects Input

`XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet` takes an array of objects and returns a worksheet with automatically-generated "headers" based on the keys of the objects. The default column order is determined by the first appearance of the field using `Object.keys`. The function accepts an options argument:

* All fields from each row will be written. If `header` is an array and it does not contain a particular field, the key will be appended to the array.
* Cell types are deduced from the type of each value. For example, a `Date` object will generate a Date cell, while a string will generate a Text cell.
* Null values will be skipped by default. If `nullError` is true, an error cell corresponding to `#NULL!` will be written to the worksheet.

`XLSX.utils.sheet_add_json` takes an array of objects and updates an existing worksheet object. It follows the same process as `json_to_sheet` and accepts an options argument:

`origin` is expected to be one of:

#### HTML Table Input

`XLSX.utils.table_to_sheet` takes a table DOM element and returns a worksheet resembling the input table. Numbers are parsed. All other data will be stored as strings.

`XLSX.utils.table_to_book` produces a minimal workbook based on the worksheet.

Both functions accept options arguments:

Note: `XLSX.read` can handle HTML represented as strings.

`XLSX.utils.sheet_add_dom` takes a table DOM element and updates an existing worksheet object. It follows the same process as `table_to_sheet` and accepts an options argument:

`origin` is expected to be one of:

#### Formulae Output

`XLSX.utils.sheet_to_formulae` generates an array of commands that represent how a person would enter data into an application. Each entry is of the form `A1-cell-address=formula-or-value`. String literals are prefixed with a `'` in accordance with Excel.

#### Delimiter-Separated Output

As an alternative to the `writeFile` CSV type, `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_csv` also produces CSV output. The function takes an options argument:

* `strip` will remove trailing commas from each line under default `FS/RS`
* `blankrows` must be set to `false` to skip blank lines.
* Fields containing the record or field separator will automatically be wrapped in double quotes; `forceQuotes` forces all cells to be wrapped in quotes.
* `XLSX.write` with `csv` type will always prepend the UTF-8 byte-order mark for Excel compatibility. `sheet_to_csv` returns a JS string and omits the mark. Using `XLSX.write` with type `string` will also skip the mark.

**UTF-16 Unicode Text**

The `txt` output type uses the tab character as the field separator. If the `codepage` library is available (included in full distribution but not core), the output will be encoded in `CP1200` and the BOM will be prepended.

`XLSX.utils.sheet_to_txt` takes the same arguments as `sheet_to_csv`.

#### HTML Output

As an alternative to the `writeFile` HTML type, `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html` also produces HTML output. The function takes an options argument:

#### JSON

`XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json` generates different types of JS objects. The function takes an options argument:

* `raw` only affects cells which have a format code (`.z`) field or a formatted text (`.w`) field.
* If `header` is specified, the first row is considered a data row; if `header` is not specified, the first row is the header row and not considered data.
* When `header` is not specified, the conversion will automatically disambiguate header entries by affixing `_` and a count starting at `1`. For example, if three columns have header `foo` the output fields are `foo`, `foo_1`, `foo_2`
* `null` values are returned when `raw` is true but are skipped when false.
* If `defval` is not specified, null and undefined values are skipped normally. If specified, all null and undefined points will be filled with `defval`
* When `header` is `1`, the default is to generate blank rows. `blankrows` must be set to `false` to skip blank rows.
* When `header` is not `1`, the default is to skip blank rows. `blankrows` must be true to generate blank rows

`range` is expected to be one of:

`header` is expected to be one of:

* If header is not `1`, the row object will contain the non-enumerable property `__rowNum__` that represents the row of the sheet corresponding to the entry.
* If header is an array, the keys will not be disambiguated. This can lead to unexpected results if the array values are not unique!

### File Formats

Despite the library name `xlsx`, it supports numerous spreadsheet file formats:

Features not supported by a given file format will not be written. Formats with range limits will be silently truncated:

Excel 2003 SpreadsheetML range limits are governed by the version of Excel and are not enforced by the writer.
